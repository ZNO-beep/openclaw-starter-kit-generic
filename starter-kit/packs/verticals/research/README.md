# Research Vertical Pack

Adds research-focused tools and agent helpers (e.g., YouTube search/transcripts, download helpers) and supporting playbooks.

## Philosophy
- Prefer **upstream/bundled skills** where available.
- Package custom tools as **sanitized templates** (no API keys/tokens).
- Provide install scripts to copy tools into `~/.clawdbot/tools/`.

## Install
```bash
bash starter-kit/packs/verticals/research/scripts/install.sh
```

## Validate
```bash
bash starter-kit/packs/verticals/research/scripts/validate.sh
```
